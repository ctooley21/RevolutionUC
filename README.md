# Snapsey
Snapsey is an Android application built using image recognition, allowing for the detection of food products. This detection allows for us to get health information, and subsequently translate that information into a specific language.
# Why?
Nearly 250 million people in the world suffer from food allergies, many of these people can often times find themselves in areas of the world where they do not speak the local language. This can prevent people from having safe and healthy food to eat.
# Outcome
During the 24 hour hackathon we were able to develop the basic application. We used image recognition and a translate api for our image and data handling.
